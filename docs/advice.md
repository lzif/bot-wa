# Advice for New Developers

Welcome to the project! Here are some general tips and best practices to help you get started:

-   **Familiarize yourself with the codebase:** Before you start writing code, take some time to explore the project structure. Pay attention to how commands are organized and how the different modules in the `src/tools` directory are used.
-   **Understand the global variables:** The `config` and `tools` objects are available globally. Make sure you understand what they provide and how to use them.
-   **Follow the coding style:** Try to maintain a consistent coding style with the rest of the project.
-   **Test your changes:** Before submitting your code, make sure to test your changes thoroughly to ensure they don't introduce any bugs.
-   **Write clear commit messages:** When you commit your changes, write a clear and concise commit message that explains what you've done.
-   **Don't be afraid to ask for help:** If you're stuck or have any questions, don't hesitate to ask for help.
